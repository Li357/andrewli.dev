[Last post]({% link _posts/2021-01-25-quotients-normal-subgroups.md %}) I discussed the First Isomorphism Theorem with the goal of making it seem natural. This post, I'll try to extend (as mathematicians tend to like doing) that intuitive feel to the other isomorphism theorems. Since there isn't an agreed-upon way to enumerate them, I'll go ahead and name them how I'll present them, in all their symbolic beauty:

> **The First Isomorphism Theorem.** Let $G$ and $\bar{G}$ be groups and $\phi : G \rightarrow \bar{G}$ be a homomorphism between them. Then
> $$G / \ker \phi \cong \phi(G),$$
> where $\phi(G) = \{\phi(g) : g \in G\}$ is the image of $\phi$ under $G$. Explicitly, the isomorphism is given by the map $g\ker \phi \mapsto \phi(g)$.

> **The Second Isomorphism Theorem.** Let $K$ be an arbitrary subgroup of $G$, and let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. Then
> $$\frac{KN}{N} \cong \frac{K}{K \cap N},$$
> where $KN = \{kn : k \in K, n \in N\}$. Explicitly, the isomorphism is given by the map $g(H \cap N) \mapsto gN$.

> **The Third Isomorphism Theorem.** Let $G$ be a group and $H, K$ be normal subgroups of $G$, with $H \leq K$. Then
> $$\frac{G/H}{K/H} \cong G/K.$$

> **The Fourth Isomorphism (Lattice) Theorem.** Let $G$ be a group and $N$ be a subgroup of $G$. There is a bijection between the set of subgroups of $G$ containing $N$, call it $\mathcal{G}$, and the set of subgroups of $G/N$, call it $\mathcal{N}$. Explicitly, the bijection is given by the map $A \mapsto A/N$.
